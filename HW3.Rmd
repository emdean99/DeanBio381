#Question 1:

```
Find: **\h{2,}**

replace: **\,**

In this section I found the spaces and replaced them with a colon. Since we did not want to mess with the page breaks, we set it to be \h insterad of \s which would mess with line breaks.However, there is a word with a space so a genaric **\h** was not going to work. We used \h{2,} to specify that areas with 2 or more spaces needed to be turned into what we replaced as \,.
