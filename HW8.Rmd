# Study System

I am using the example data from an experiment I am creating on CPB. In this I am exposing beetles to curcumin and seeing how that changes their survival because it should cause changes in their epigenetic mechanisms possibly associated with insecticide resistance.

If this were true I would see less survive when exposed to the determined LC50 when exposed to these chemicals.

# Deciding on Data formats

I decided on the values based on my previous research into the topic and talking with the other people in my lab. Generally this is the ideal outcome I would like with a 25% increase in mortality, however when looking at the minimum needed value (helping me determine variance) they said that in my experiment a change of a few percent would still generally be significant.

I also did this many beetles because I cannot do this in lab because of time being an undergraduate, but ideally I would love 1000 replicates.

# Creating Random Data and Analyze the data

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Control survival when exposed to lc50 with survivors being 1

Survival_C = rnorm(1000, mean = 0.5, sd = 1)

# 0.25mg curcumin exposure survival rate

Survival_L = rnorm(1000, mean = 0.35, sd = 1)

# 1mg curcumin exposure survival rate

Survival_H = rnorm(1000, mean = 0.25, sd = 1)

# Organize data ------------------------------

survival_total = data.frame(ID = 1:3000, c(Survival_C, Survival_L, Survival_H), Treatment = c(rep('control', 1000), rep('low_curcumin', 1000), rep('high_curcumin', 1000)))

colnames(survival_total)[2] <- ('Survival')

# analyze the data ------------------------------

summary_surv = summary(survival_total)
print(summary_surv)

stats <- aov(Survival ~ Treatment, data = survival_total)

stats_sum <- summary(stats)

print(stats_sum)

# create a boxplot ------------------------------

ano_plot <- ggplot(stats) + aes(x = Treatment, y = Survival) + geom_boxplot()
